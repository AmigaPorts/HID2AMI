**HID2AMI** is an **HID mouse to quadrature waveform converter** and **HID Gamepad adapter** for the Amiga (and C64, Atari 7600, AtariST also..) series of boards; it allows ANY modern HID mouse (not limited to PS/2-USB) and almost ANY (*) modern digital/analog Gamepad to be connected and enjoyed with our Amiga computers.

(*) At the moment it has been tested against dozens of different gamepdas,  but working for each and every existing Gamepad cannot be guaranteed; nevertheless, if you find a Pad which does not work with HID2AMI, you are encouraged to contact the author and supply him its "HID Report Descriptor" to be investigated.

## **HOW DOES IT WORK** (in brief):

HID2AMI recognizes and manages any HID device connected to its USB interface; if the device is recognized as an HID mouse, then HID2AMI starts capturing live movements and button pressings of the peripheral, then converting both of them into proper quadrature waveforms (and Amiga mouse button pressings) which can be properly understood by the Amiga itself, as if a real quadrature "Amiga" mouse was connected.

If the device is recognized as an HID gamepad, then HID2AMI maps pad's controls on the Amiga Joystick port/interface.
Gamepad's buttons are mapped evenly on Amiga button1/button2/UP/DOWN (useful for jump & racing games) inputs.
Starting from fw 1.7.1 a custom mapping can be freely configured and stored for automatic retrieval upon reconnection.

There is no need to manually configure the emulation mode: device recognition and operation mode switching are automatically performed by HID2AMI itself.

## **GETTING STARTED AND USER GUIDE**:

Here you can find a quick user guide, describing basic operations and the available meta-commands for peripheral's profile customization, storage and retrieval.

 ## **HW AND SCHEMATICS**
  
|   Flavour      | Current ver.  |                Features               |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| HID2AMI LITE   |    v1.0.0     |   direct output to Amiga port lines   |
| HID2AMI DeLuxe |    v1.1.0     |   output lines driven by mosfet       |
  
 
  *Two version of HID2AMI exist: Lite version (yellow) and DeLuxe version (blue/black). They are different in the way outputs to Amiga ports are buffered (DeLuxe version outputs go through mosfet buffers, for maximum compatibility with "weak" amigas).*

## **READ CAREFULLY BEFORE CONNECTING ANY PAD/MOUSE TO YOUR AMIGA**

 **BE AWARE** that when you connect a peripheral to the Amiga's mouse/joy port, the power supply or that peripheral comes from/through that port itself. **Be aware that improperly connecting an "high" power-demanding device could lead to overheat or even damage the Amiga joy/mouse port**. 

If you connect controllers with rechargeable batteries, **be absolutely confident that the battery has been fully charged**  **BEFORE** connecting it to the Amiga, or the charging current flowing from the joy/mouse port to your controller's battery could seriosly damage your Commodore  !

 You are usign HID2AMI at your own risk: I will either not be liable nor responsible for any damage you could cause to your hardware for any use or misuse of HID2AMI together with your systems.  





## **COMPATIBILITY LIST**

(!) HID2AMI has been tested against a number of HID compliant Mice and Gamepads; the following compatibility list keeps track of tested peripherals. If you tested your mice/Gamepads and want to contribute to the list, simply send an email to the author with your compatibility results. In case your device is not handled properly, you ca submit the author an HID dump to be investigated.

 (1) Plug the pad in adaptor #1 port
 
 (2) **WARNING! If using the wired version, either remove internal battery (suggested) or be sure it is 100% charged before connecting to your Amiga**
 
## **DEVELOPMENT**

HID2AMI hardware and firmware were designed, developed and maintained by **Sampedenawa** on behalf of **EmberHeavyIndustries** (an evil worldwide company, whose mission is to rule the world by the mean of reviving Amiga computers), following a discussion born on Italian www.amigapage.it Amiga forum.


## **ASSEMBLY**

 ## **WARNING !!  A COUPLE THINGS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BEFORE GOING FURTHER**
 
 - **NEVER, NEVER, NEVER connect "both sides" of HID2AMI to a power source at the same time !**
 **This means: do not connect HID2AMI to a PC through the USB port while it is plugged into your Amiga's joy/mouse port !**
 **If you want to upgrade your HID2AMI with bootloader or DFU mode, beware to disconnect it from your Amiga first !**
 
 - **BE AWARE** that when you connect a peripheral to the Amiga's mouse/joy port, the power supply or that peripheral comes from/through that port itself. Amiga control peripheral ports were probably not designed with "mega-rumble-end-of-universe-nuclear-powered" gamepads in mind: while there is generally no risk in connecting "common" mainstream peripherals like the ones have been tested (see above), be aware that improperly connecting an "high" power-demanding device could lead to overheat or even damage the Amiga joy/mouse port. **You can consider the power consumption safety limit roughly around 100mA; exceeding this limit could be dangerous for your Amiga!.** 
 
 ## **You are usign HID2AMI at your own risk: I will either not be liable nor responsible for any damage you could cause to your hardware for any use or misuse of HID2AMI together with your systems.**  
 


#### Starting from scratch
 - Get latest gerber files available and build the pcb with a service of your choice
 - Get the BOM and buy all needed components
 - Assemble your board (moderate soldering skills needed)
 - Put the board in DFU mode and upload bootloader (USB A-A cable, DFU drivers and a Windows PC needed) *(a)*
 - Put the board in BOOTLOADER mode, get your personal board-license-unique-code
 - Get the HID2AMI APP from the author, by sending him a request together with your board-license-unique-code
 - Put the board in BOOTLOADER mode and upload the APP *(b)*
 - Put the board in APP mode
 - Plug in and enjoy !
 
#### DIY KIT
 - Assemble your board (moderate soldering skills needed)
 - Put the board in DFU mode and upload bootloader (USB A-A cable, DFU drivers and a Windows PC needed) *(a)*
 - Put the board in BOOTLOADER mode, get your personal board-license-unique-code
 - Get the HID2AMI APP from the author, by sending him a request together with your board-license-unique-code

#### **BILL OF MATERIALS**

Components noted as "Optional" fulfil the general purpose STM32F1x reference design; generally speaking they can be safely omitted from the assembly of HID2AMI. Consider soldering any of them in case you experience some instability of any kind (never experienced so far).

LED1 is "run mode" indicator; it blinks at variable rates to indicate HID2AMI running status (suggesetd colors: green, yellow, white)
- When in BOOTLOADER mode, a fast blink means bootloader running and waiting for the "App" to be flashed/upgraded
- When in APP mode, a "regular" blinking means the App is running and waiting for input; a slower blinking (upon connecting a peripheral), means the peripheral correctly identified and mapped 

LED2 is the "power on" indicator; if lit then your board gets correct +5V and +3.3V power supply 

For both LED1 and LED2, the suggested value for their respective limiting current resistors is 10k, but you can safely experiment any value in range 1k-47k depending on the led components characteristics and light efficiency (and your personal taste)

is distribuited by request from the author; each instance is strictly tied 1:1 to a particular HID2AMI board. You are not allowed to copy and distribuite HID2AMI APP in any medium or format. 

## **DISTRIBUTION AND PRICING POLICY**
I've spent a great effort in designing and developing this app, so I would be grateful if you'd be happy to contibute to its future development. I decided to release all project's details, schematics and gerbers for free to everyone, but retaining myself close control over the firmware app. Being this one a no-profit hobbyist project, I can't guarantee any volume production of boards, so I will following the following distributio policies, for who may be interested in having one:

- Software only
  - You build the board yourself, by mean of the public gerbers or by a compatible custom layout you derive from schematics
  - You get the APP from me by sending me a request together with your personal 4-digits code (see instructiuons above how to get it)
  - Availability to serve request and cost of the app shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting. Find HID2AMI on [Amigapage](http://www.amigapage.it), [EAB](https://eab.abime.net), [A1K](https://www.a1k.org). 

- DYI KIT
  - You build the board yourself by getting from me the pcb and all needed components
  - You get the APP from me by sending me a request together with your personal 4-digits code 
  - Availability and costs of DIY kits shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting. Find HID2AMI on [Amigapage](http://www.amigapage.it), [EAB](https://eab.abime.net), [A1K](https://www.a1k.org).

- COMPLETE BOARD
  - You get the fully working board from me by sending me a request 
  - (Rare) Availability and costs of complete boards shall be exposed here or on the Amiga Forums I (Sampedenawa) am frequenting
