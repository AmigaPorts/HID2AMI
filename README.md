**HID2AMI** is an **HID mouse to quadrature waveform converter** and **HID Gamepad adapter** for the Amiga (and AtariST also..) series of boards; it allows ANY modern HID mouse (not limited to PS/2-USB) and almost ANY (*) modern digital/analog Gamepad to be connected and enjoyed with our Amiga computers.

(*) At the moment it has been tested with most Logitech Wingman, Thrustmaster series Gamepads and PS3/PC Gamepad clones, Xbox Gamepad clones (Xbox pads does not strictly comply to HID protocol). Working for each and every existing Gamepad cannot be guaranteed, but if you find a Pad which does not work with HID2AMI, you are encouraged to contact the author and supply him its "HID Report Descriptor" to be investigated.

## **HOW DOES IT WORK** (in brief):

HID2AMI recognizes and manages any HID device connected to its USB interface; if the device is recognized as an HID mouse, then HID2AMI starts capturing live movements and button pressings of the peripheral, then converting both of them into proper quadrature waveforms (and Amiga mouse button pressings) which can be properly understood by the Amiga itself, as if a real quadrature "Amiga" mouse was connected.

If the device is recognized as an HID gamepad, then HID2AMI maps pad's controls on the Amiga Joystick port/interface.
Gamepad's buttons are mapped evenly on Amiga button1/button2/UP (useful for jump & racing games) inputs.

There is no need to manually configure the emulation mode: device recognition and operation mode switching are automatically performed by HID2AMI itself.


 ## **HW AND SCHEMATICS**
  
|   Flavour      | Current ver.  |                Features               |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| HID2AMI LITE   |    v1.0.0     |   direct output to Amiga port lines   |
| HID2AMI DeLuxe |    v1.0.0     |   output lines driven by mosfet       |
  
 
  *Two version of HID2AMI exist: Lite version (yellow) and DeLuxe version (blue). They are different in the way outputs to Amiga ports are buffered (DeLuxe version outputs go through mosfet buffers, for maximum compatibility with "weak" amigas).*

## **DEVELOPMENT**

HID2AMI hardware and firmware were designed, developed and maintained by **Sampedenawa** on behalf of **EmberHeavyIndustries** (an evil worldwide company, whose mission is to rule the world by the mean of reviving Amiga computers), following a discussion born on Italian www.amigapage.it Amiga forum.


## **ASSEMBLY**

 ## **WARNING !!  A COUPLE THINGS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BEFORE GOING FURTHER**
 
 - **NEVER, NEVER, NEVER connect "both sides" of HID2AMI to a power source at the same time !**
 **This means: do not connect HID2AMI to a PC through the USB port while it is plugged into your Amiga's joy/mouse port !**
 **If you want to upgrade your HID2AMI with bootloader or DFU mode, beware to disconnect it from your Amiga first !**
 
 - **BE AWARE** that when you connect a peripheral to the Amiga's mouse/joy port, the power supply or that peripheral comes from/through that port itself. Amiga control peripheral ports were probably not designed with "mega-rumble-end-of-universe-nuclear-powered" gamepads in mind: while there is generally no risk in connecting "common" mainstream peripherals like the ones have been tested (see above), be aware that improperly connecting an "high" power-demanding device could lead to overheat or even damage the Amiga joy/mouse port. You are usign HID2AMI at your own risk: I will either not be liable nor responsible for any damage you could cause to your hardware for any use or misuse of HID2AMI together with your systems.

#### **BILL OF MATERIALS**

Components noted as "Optional" fulfil the general purpose STM32F1x reference design; generally speaking they can be safely omitted from the assembly of HID2AMI. Consider soldering any of them in case you experience some instability of any kind (never experienced so far).

LED1 is "run mode" indicator; it blinks at variable rates to indicate HID2AMI running status (suggesetd colors: green, yellow, white)
- When in BOOTLOADER mode, a fast blink means bootloader running and waiting for the "App" to be flashed/upgarded
- When in APP mode, a "regular" blinking means the App is running and waiting for input; a slower blinking (upon connecting a peripheral), means the peripheral correctly identified and mapped 

LED2 is the "power on" indicator; if lit then your board gets correct +5V and +3.3V power supply 

For both LED1 and LED2, the suggested value for their respective limiting current resistors is 10k, but you can safely experiment any value in range 1k-47k depending on the led components characteristics and light efficiency (and your personal taste)

[HID2AMI v1.0.0 DELUXE BRD](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Board/HID2AMI.Deluxe.Rev1.0.0.redist.brd)

### **BOOTLOADER**

Current BOOTLOADER version is 1.3.0. You can freely get it from here [HID2AMIBOOTLOADER](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Firmware/HID2AMIBOOTLOADER.dfu)


### **FLASHING INSTRUCTIONS**

#### **PREREQUISITES**
In order to be able to flash both the bootloader and the HID2AMI app, you need:
- A MS-Windows PC
- An A-A USB cable (https://www.google.com/search?q=a-a+usb+cable)
- The free ST DFU Tools. Download the package from here (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html)

#### **FLASHING THE BOOTLOADER**
- Install the ST DFU Tool package on your Windows machine. Make sure you have the ST DFU-USB driver installed (in case something went wrong, you can manually install them from the DFU Tool's directory)
- Set HID2AMI in DFU-BOOT mode, by selecting position 2-3 for both "BOOT0" and "PA9BOOT" jumpers
- MAKE SURE THAT HID2AMI IS NOT CONNECTED TO YOUR AMIGA MOUSE/JOY PORT
- Connect HID2AMI to any USB port of your PC, by mean of the A-A USB Cable
- After few seconds, HID2AMI should be recognized by Windows as "ST Device in DFU Mode"
- Launch "DfuSeDemo" App from ST Tools package. You should see a form like this one, showing your HID2AMI has booted in DFU mode and has been recognized properly ![DFU-BOOT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/master/Pics/50-01.Dfu.Boot.jpg)
- Select the HID2AMIBOOTLOADER.dfu file you previosly downloaded from [here](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Firmware/HID2AMIBOOTLOADER.dfu) by pressing "Choose" under "Upgrade or Verify Action". 
You should come to a condition like this          ![DFU-BOOT-INJECT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/master/Pics/50-02.Dfu.Bootloader.inject.jpg)
- Press "Upgrade" button and waity the process to finish with success.

#### **RETRIEVING YOUR PERSONAL BOARD CODE**
If everything went fine, your board now can boot from the BOOTLOADER and is ready to be loaded with the HID2AMI App
- Set HID2AMI in BOOTLOADER mode, by selectin position 1-2 for "BOOT0" and position 2-3 for "PA9BOOT"
- MAKE SURE THAT HID2AMI IS NOT CONNECTED TO YOUR AMIGA MOUSE/JOY PORT
- Connect HID2AMI to any USB port of your PC, by mean of the A-A USB Cable: the bootloader should take control, and you should see the activity led on board (lower led near usb connector) fastly blinking
- Look at DfuSeDemo window: you should see something like as follows. Note down the four characters you see near "Version" field ![DFU-BOOTLOADED](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/master/Pics/50-03.HID2AMI.Dfu.codeget.jpg)
- In order to get a properly signed app, working tied to your board, you have to ask it from the author, by sending him an [email](mailto:EmberHEavyIndustries@gmail.com) together with your personal code, which is the four character as above (in the case of the picture is "D530", yours should obviously be different)

#### **FLASHING THE HID2AMI APP**
- Once received your personalized app file, in the form "HID2AMIAPP.XXXX.dfu", boot again HID2AMI in BOOTLOADER mode (just as above), "Choose" the app file "HID2AMIAPP.XXXX.dfu" and press "Upgrade" ![DFU-LOADAPP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/master/Pics/50-04.HID2AMI.Dfu.App.Inject.jpg)
- You're done ! Put the HID2AMI board in APP mode by by selecting position 1-2 for both "BOOT0" and "PA9BOOT" jumpers, **DISCONNECT you HID2AMI board from your Windows PC** and connect it to any Mouse/Joy port of your Amiga
- Enjoy !
